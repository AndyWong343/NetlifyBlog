# 1.0 Overview
### 1.1 Mapping clarity vs aesthetics

The chart provided in the DataViz Makeover assignment 1 overall looks somewhat aesthetically pleasing, but is unclear on the details of the chart. Based on this, the chart falls into Quadrant IV of the matrix:

# 2.0 The Makeover
### 2.1 Critique of the visualisation and suggested improvements
#### **2.1.1 Clarity**
S/n | Critique | Suggestions for improvement
- | ------ | ------
1 | _Unclear Subtitle_. It is not clear what the subtitle "Per Cent" refers to. It looks to almost be put there as an afterthought. | _Remove the subtitle_ altogether and label the appropriate axis with “%”. This will reduce extra text, and still present the percentage values in a more intuitive manner.
2 | _X-axis is not explained_. There are no labels to explain what the three types of values on the x axis mean. | _Pivot the data_ such that the percentages are on the x-axis and the age group is on the y-axis, and label the axes accordingly. This will improve the clarity of the visualisation.
3 | _Unclear presentation of age group information_. It would be clearer if percentage was presented on the y axis instead of the x axis, as the x axis is usually used to present time period. Together with the blue and grey lines in the line graph, it intuitively looked as though to present as a timeline; only upon further examination was it understood to be meant to present age proportion in percentage. | _Pivot the data_ such that age group is presented on the y axis, as the x axis is usually used to present time period. This will make the visualization more intuitive to the reader.
4 | _Duplicate presentation of information_. The two lines in the line graph essentially present the same information as the percentage values for June 2009 and June 2019 in the x-axis. The line graph provided the visual trend, while the percentage values in the a-axis provided the actual percentage values. This duplication would not be needed with better visualization design. | _Remove the June 2009 and June 2019 percentage values on the x-axis_. This will no longer be necessary if the data is presented appropriately.

#### **2.1.2 Aesthetics**
S/n | Critique | Suggestions for improvement
- | ------ | ------
1 | _Good use of colour to differentiate the 2 time periods_. A more contrasting colour scheme might be better. | _To use two more appealing colours_ to enhance the contrast and clarity of the 2 sets of data being compared.
2 | _Clear labeling_ of what the two lines in the line graph represent, and the median ages. However, better designed aesthetics could allow for more concise labels (use less words). | _Include labels_ as necessary.
3 | With 3 different values, the _x-axis is too cluttered_. | This will be solved when the data is _pivoted appropriately_, as mentioned above.
4 | As a minor point: although best practice states that number ranges should start with 0, there is no need for the age group to start from 0 as this graph is to present the labour force which is consists of all persons aged 15 years and over (https://stats.mom.gov.sg/SL/Pages/Labour-Force-Introduction.aspx). The age group still covers the entire range of legal working age ranges so it is sufficient. | No action necessary.

### 2.3 Building the visualisation

This visualisation was built using [Tableau Desktop Professional Edition 2020.4.0](httpshttps://www.tableau.com/products/desktop).

S/n | Step | Action
- | --- | ------
1 | Import data into Tableau | Import Excel file into Tableau ![](images/picture3.jpg){width=100%}
2 | Clean the data | The data is not standardized and clean, because the formatting of the spreadsheet is not friendly for data importation. ![](images/picture4.jpg){width=100%}
3 | Clean the data | Clicking on the “Cleaned with Data Interpreter” will clean up the data significantly and allow for easier cleaning.  ![](images/picture5.jpg){width=100%}
4 | Clean the data | Hide the left-most column as it is not useful for this analysis. ![](images/picture6.jpg){width=75%}
5 | Clean the data | Rename “Age (Years) 1” column to “Age Group” for clarity. ![](images/picture7.jpg){height=75%}
6 | Clean the data | Check that “Age” column is of the correct data type (string). ![](images/picture8.jpg){width=75%}
7 | Clean the data | Check that the rest of the year columns are of the correct data type (Number[decimal]). ![](images/picture9.jpg){width=100%}
8 | Build the visualisation | Drag "2009" and "2019" to the Columns pane.
9 | Build the visualisation | Drag "Age Group" to the Rows pane. ![](images/picture10.jpg){width=100%}
10 | Build the visualisation | Exclude "NULL" and "Total" columns from the chart, as these are not useful for the analysis.
11 | Build the visualisation | Exclude overlapping age groups, as these will confuse the data presented in the visualisation. ![](images/picture11.jpg){width=75%}
12 | Build the visualisation | Sort Age Group in descending order.
13 | Build the visualisation | Select "Dual Axis" to combine the two charts into one. ![](images/picture12.jpg){width=75%}
14 | Build the visualisation | Select "Synchronise Axis" to ensure both charts' axes match. ![](images/picture13.jpg){width=75%}
15 | Build the visualisation | Remove "Show Header" to show only one y-axis. ![](images/picture14.jpg){width=75%}
16 | Build the visualisation | Change the 2019 Mark to Bar chart. ![](images/picture15.jpg){width=75%}
17 | Build the visualisation | Swap "SUM(2019)" to the front of the Columns pane to display the 2019 chart behind the 2009 chart. ![](images/picture16.jpg){width=100%}
18 | Build the visualisation | Edit the range of the x-axis to show the whole range of 0% to 100%. Rename label as "LFPR(%)". ![](images/picture17.jpg){width=100%}
19 | Build the visualisation | Change the view to "Entire View" for visual clarity. ![](images/picture18.jpg){width=75%}
20 | Build the visualisation | Edit the chart title. ![](images/picture19.jpg){width=100%}
21 | Build the visualisation | Edit the Legend title to "Year". ![](images/picture20.jpg){width=75%}
22 | Build the visualisation | Rename the Sheet. ![](images/picture21.jpg){width=100%}
23 | Build the visualisation | The completed chart looks like this: ![](images/picture22.jpg){width=100%}

### 2.4 Some key observations from the visualisation
S/n | Observation
- | ------
1 | The 25 to 29 age group had the highest LFPR in 2009. Ten years later in 2019, the age group with the highest LFPR was 30 to 34.
2 | The largest increase in LFPR from 2009 to 2019 is amongst the 50 to 64, and 65 to 69 age groups. This is expected of a an [ageing population](https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-In-Singapore-2019.aspx).
3 | Of all the LFPR age groups, only the 20 to 24 age group declined in LFPR from 2009 to 2019. This is the only exception amongst all the LFPR age groups.
4 | 4.	The lower the age group, the lower the increase in LFPR from 2009 to 2019, with the exception of the 15 to 19 age group, which seemed to reverse the trend compared to the next older age group. This seems to contradict Singapore’s Total Fertility Rate (TFR) which [has been declining](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/modules/infographics/total-fertility-rate) consistently, but may have been bolstered by the slight up-tick in TFR in 2000.
